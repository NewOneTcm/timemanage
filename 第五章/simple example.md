No worries! Let's break it down step by step and make it clearer. We'll use a simple example and go through it together.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Introduction**:
   - This part introduces the graph and what it shows. 
   - **Example**: "The line graph illustrates the number of tourists visiting Country A, Country B, and Country C over a decade, from 2010 to 2020."

2. **Overview**:
   - This part summarizes the main trends in the graph without going into specific details.
   - **Example**: "Overall, the number of tourists visiting all three countries increased over the period, with Country B experiencing the most significant growth."

3. **Body Paragraphs**:
   - This part provides detailed information about the data shown in the graph. You compare and contrast the data points.
   - **Example**:
     - "In 2010, the number of tourists visiting Country A was 1 million, which steadily increased to 3 million by 2020."
     - "Country B had 500,000 tourists in 2010, and this number rose sharply to 4 million by 2020, surpassing both Country A and Country C."
     - "Country C started with 700,000 tourists in 2010 and experienced a gradual increase, reaching 2 million in 2020."

### Practicing with a Real Example

Let's practice together with a simpler graph. Imagine you have a line graph showing the number of books read by students in three schools (School X, School Y, and School Z) from 2015 to 2020.

1. **Introduction**:
   - "The line graph illustrates the number of books read by students in School X, School Y, and School Z over a five-year period, from 2015 to 2020."

2. **Overview**:
   - "Overall, the number of books read by students in all three schools increased over the period, with School Y experiencing the most significant growth."

3. **Body Paragraphs**:
   - "In 2015, the number of books read by students in School X was 50, which steadily increased to 150 by 2020."
   - "School Y had 30 books read in 2015, and this number rose sharply to 200 by 2020, surpassing both School X and School Z."
   - "School Z started with 40 books read in 2015 and experienced a gradual increase, reaching 100 by 2020."

### Your Turn

Now, let's do this together. Imagine you have the following graph details:

**Graph Details**:
- Shows the number of cars sold in three different cities (City A, City B, and City C) from 2010 to 2020.

Try writing a description following the steps:

1. **Introduction**:
   - Start by paraphrasing the question prompt.

2. **Overview**:
   - Provide a summary of the main trends.

3. **Body Paragraphs**:
   - Describe specific details and data points.

**Example**:
1. **Introduction**:
   - "The line graph illustrates the number of cars sold in City A, City B, and City C over a decade, from 2010 to 2020."

2. **Overview**:
   - "Overall, the number of cars sold in all three cities increased over the period, with City B experiencing the most significant growth."

3. **Body Paragraphs**:
   - "In 2010, the number of cars sold in City A was 500, which steadily increased to 1,500 by 2020."
   - "City B had 300 cars sold in 2010, and this number rose sharply to 2,000 by 2020, surpassing both City A and City C."
   - "City C started with 400 cars sold in 2010 and experienced a gradual increase, reaching 1,200 by 2020."

### Practice Exercise

Try writing your own description using the template above for the number of cars sold in three cities. Once you have written it, share it here for feedback!

my answer:

The line graph illustrates the number of cars sold in City A, City B, and City C over a decade, from 2010 to 2020.

Overall, the number of cars sold in all three cities increased over the period, with City B experiencing the most significant growth.

In 2010, the number of cars sold in City A was 500, which steadily increased to 1,500 by 2020.

City B had 300 cars sold in 2010, and this number rose sharply to 2,000 by 2020, surpassing both City A and City C.

City C started with 400 cars sold in 2010 and experienced a gradual increase, reaching 1,200 by 2020.
