Some people think that environmental problems should be solved on a global scale while others believe it is better to deal with them nationally. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

**Introduction**: There is a debate about whether environmental issues should be tackled globally or nationally. In my opinion, environmental issues should be addressed nationally, considering the varying economic strengths and levels of education in different countries.

**Body Paragraph 1**: One reason for tackling environmental problems nationally is the economic disparity between countries. Some nations do not have the financial resources to invest in high-quality facilities to manage environmental issues. For example, North Korea prioritizes spending on food and basic necessities, leaving little budget for environmental concerns. This economic constraint makes it difficult for such countries to participate effectively in global environmental initiatives.

**Body Paragraph 2**: Another reason is the level of education in different countries. In some regions, the population may not be well-informed about the importance of environmental conservation. For instance, in certain African countries, limited access to education means that people may not recognize environmental degradation as a significant problem. Consequently, investing in environmental solutions might be seen as less important, and efforts to improve the environment could be undermined by a lack of public support and awareness.

**Conclusion**: In summary, I believe that environmental problems should be addressed nationally due to differences in economic capabilities and educational levels. By focusing on national strategies, countries can tailor their approaches to fit their unique circumstances and resources.

Some people believe that technology has made life easier and more convenient. Others argue that technology has made life more complex and stressful. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

There is an ongoing debate about whether technology has made life easier and more convenient or more complex and stressful. In my opinion, technology has significantly improved our daily lives, making them more efficient and convenient.

One reason technology enhances our lives is the accessibility of knowledge through the internet. We can learn from the most intelligent people around the world. For instance, people often learn new skills and gain knowledge from educational videos on platforms like YouTube, which provides access to global wisdom and expertise.

Another reason is that technology allows us to communicate with people over long distances. For example, we can take a photo and instantly share it with friends in another city, keeping them updated on what we are doing. This instant communication strengthens our connections with others, no matter where they are.

In summary, technology makes life more convenient by providing access to quality education and enabling us to connect with people from different places. As technology continues to advance, it will further enhance our daily lives, making them even more efficient and enjoyable.

Some people think that public libraries are no longer necessary because of the availability of digital information. Others believe that public libraries still play an important role in society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

**Introduction**: There is an ongoing debate about whether public libraries are no longer necessary or still play an important role in society. In my opinion, public libraries continue to play a significant role by providing access to education and offering a conducive environment for learning.

**Body Paragraph 1**: One reason public libraries are important is that they supply a wide range of books for those who cannot afford to buy them. For instance, some people want to learn new knowledge but cannot afford to purchase books, which are readily available in libraries. This access to free resources is crucial for promoting education among economically disadvantaged individuals.

**Body Paragraph 2**: Another reason is that public libraries provide a good environment for people who want to study during their spare time. For example, at home, we might be disturbed by family members, but in a library, we can concentrate better. This quiet and focused environment makes study time more effective.

**Conclusion**: In summary, public libraries provide access to quality education for people with financial difficulties and offer a focused environment for studying. As public libraries continue to support our educational needs and enhance our daily lives, they remain an essential part of our society.
